# OTA Notes API

This project is a simple RESTful API for notes created with Node.js and Express framework. The notes data is setup in a JSON file, and each note consists of an id, title and a body. The note body is optional.

## Start the application

Run `npx nx serve ota-todo` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Running tests

Run `npx nx run ota-todo-e2e:test` after starting the application via `npx nx serve ota-todo`. Note that these tests are dependent on the original data stored in `/assets/data.json`, and it's ideal to revert changes to the JSON file prior to running the tests.

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build ota-todo` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
